Version Control System : 
_________________________

Assume, you are working in a project, at first you are downloading the master copy of the project into your
local system(s), after that you keep on implemeting, then there are various versions of copies of projects are available known as version control system, ensures in that versions which is correct one we need to choose and upload as a master document at end of day. 

These all comes under version control system, as it is a system that which records changes to a file or set of files. 

Why Version COntrol : 
______________________

It gives nice support for different versions of same project. 

It simplifies concurrent work, merging changes

Git is a free open source distributed version control system designed to handle everythign from small to large projects with speed and efficiency. 


Goals of Git:
______________

    -> Speed

    -> Support for non-linear developement

    -. fully Distributed

    -> Able to handled large projects efficiently. 


Once you create an account and create a repository, then you need to clone the repository

git clone url
