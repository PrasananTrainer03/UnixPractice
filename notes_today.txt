1) pwd (Print Working Directory) 

2) cd (Changes to the default directory)

3) mkdir directory_name

4) To change to particular directory

cd directory_name

5) To see the list of files

ls

6) ls -l (Used for long listing of files)

7) touch file_name (Used to create an empty file) 

8) To see the contents of the file 

cat file_name

9) To create a file, we need to use

cat > file_name 

after typing the content, if you want to save the content

<ctrl+d>

10) mv command 

used to rename the given file 

   mv old_file new_file

11) cp command 

used to copy the file from one location to another location

cp old_file new_file

12) rm file_name

used to remove the file 

13) rmdir dir_name

used to remove the directory 

14) wc filter :

	Used to display no.of words/lines/chars of the given file. 

wc -c file_name : No.of Characters

wc -w file_name  : No.of Words

wc -l file_name  : No.of Lines


15) grep (Globally Search for Regular Expression and PrintOut) 

grep "Happy" training.txt

grep -c "Happy" training.txt

16) head : displays no.of lines at top 

head -5 file_name

17) tail : Displays no.of lines at bottom

tail -5 file_name

18) | pipe operator used for redirecting 

19) sort : Used to sort the given data 

sort file_name

To redirect the output to another file, we need to use >, 

To give any file as input, then we need the help of <,

sort < file_name > target_file

sort < students.txt > res2.txt


sort -r < students.txt > res2.txt

sort -r : Used to sort in reverse order 

20) tr filter : Used to translate the data. 

tr "[a-z]" "[A-Z]" < students.txt > res3.txt

Version Control System : 
_________________________

Assume, you are working in a project, at first you are downloading the master copy of the project into your
local system(s), after that you keep on implemeting, then there are various versions of copies of projects are available known as version control system, ensures in that versions which is correct one we need to choose and upload as a master document at end of day. 

These all comes under version control system, as it is a system that which records changes to a file or set of files. 

Why Version COntrol : 
______________________

It gives nice support for different versions of same project. 

It simplifies concurrent work, merging changes

Git is a free open source distributed version control system designed to handle everythign from small to large projects with speed and efficiency. 


Goals of Git:
______________

    -> Speed

    -> Support for non-linear developement

    -. fully Distributed

    -> Able to handled large projects efficiently. 


Once you create an account and create a repository, then you need to clone the repository

git clone url

Git Basic Work Flow Life Cycle : 
__________________________________


Working Directory

	Which every default repository, you are cloned comes w.r.t. Working Directory. 

UnixPractice is the repository, where you need to get all updated files

Staging Area

	This area contains all modified or new files or new updated content in this. 

You can add the files to the staging area by 

git add file1

git add file2 


Local Repository : Contains list of files which are committed to push. 

git commit -m "message"

message is mandetory that which states that what is the push purpose, you can see them from git log later 

Remote Respository : Once you push the files to the remote repository, then authorized users can access those information. 

git push origin branch_name

git log : used to see the log information

git pull : used to pull data. 

git status : Displays the current status of your git life cycle

git diff : displays different between committed code (vs) uncommited code. 

How to Make a new branch : 
____________________________

git branch branch_name

git checkout branch_name

To Refresh branches

git remote update

To see list of branches

git branch -r 

To Remove branch

git branch -D branch_name
