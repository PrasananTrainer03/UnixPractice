Git is basically worked as central repository, for version control system. 

What is meant by version control system, means 

everyday while we are working on projects, we find multiple copies of the projects
from various project members, then we need to categorize the the versions of the project, and final project to be merged with main project.  This can be done by using git. 

There are various stages/areas of git as 

1) Working Directory

	whichever current directory or repository you are facing known as working directory.

2) Staging area

	It is available in git repository, that contains list of files to be merged 
    and need to be avaialble in git. 

3) Local repository : Contains the files, which are availble in local directory of 
	git and ready for remote.

4) Remote Repository : this directory contains all the updated code available for 
	respective project members.
