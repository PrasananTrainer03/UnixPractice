Git Life Cycle

Create Git Account

Git is a free and open-source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to large projects with speed and efficiency. 

Every git working directory conains a full-fledged repository with complegte history 

Git conatains main stages 

1) Working Directory : Which every default repository you are working known as Working Directory. 

2) Staging Area : It is a simple file, generately present in your git direcotry, that stores information about the next commit. 

3) Git Directory : Stores the metadata and object database for project (while cloning)
